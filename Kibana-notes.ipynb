We make the guess that you're working with log data, and we hope (because it's awesome) that you're working with Logstash. By default, we fill in logstash-* as your index pattern, thus the only thing you need to do is select which field contains the timestamp you'd like to use. Kibana reads your Elasticsearch mapping to find your time fields - select one from the list and hit Create."
